	<p>
		Cavern Carver is to be a 3d simulation of stone being eroded by water. The stone will be a 3d array that is static unless affected by the water. The water will be similar to that found in falling sand games, such as Powder Toy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stone Hardness in this example is determined by a perlin noise function.

	<p>
		This scan algorithm checks each tile layer by layer and executes a function on it. In this example it flips a boolean. It checks the tiles in a layer in a random order to avoid horizontal bias.
	</p>
	<p>
		An array of active tiles can be manipulated to only check necessary tiles. In this example tiles within a specific rectangle are excluded.
